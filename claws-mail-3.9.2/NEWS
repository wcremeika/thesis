-------

All plugins previously packaged as 'Extra Plugins' are now contained
within the Claws Mail package. In addition to that, the following
plugins have been dropped: TrayIcon, Dillo Viewer, and Gtkhtml2
Viewer.

This release contains the following plugins: ACPI Notifier, Address
Keeper, Attachment Remover, Attachment Warner, Bogofilter, BS Filter,
Clam AntiVirus, Fancy HTML Viewer, FetchInfo, gData, GeoLocation,
Mail Archiver, MailMBOX, New Mail, Notification, PDF Viewer, Perl,
PGP/Core, PGP/Inline, PGP/MIME, Python, RSSyl, SMime, Spam Report,
SpamAssassin, TNEF Parse, and vCalendar. 

* 3 command-line switches have been added:
  --cancel-receiving which cancels the currently running message
	retrieval operation
  --cancel-sending which cancels the currently running message
	sending operation
  --debug which toggles debug output.

  they're INVALID!).

* A 'Metadata handling' option has been added to the Miscellaneous
  options page. The options are 'safer' or 'faster'. 'faster' is
  Claws' original behaviour. 'safer' prevents data loss on system
  crashes where the filesystem is of a 'not-so-robust' variety, e.g.
  xfs. If in doubt, use 'safer'. This option defaults to 'safer'.

  Configuration dialogue in Account preferences.

  preferences, "Move deleted mails to trash and expunge immediately".

  behaviour. Turning it off prevents automatic expunging.
  Also, 'Tools/Expunge'  and 'View/Hide deleted messages' menu items
  have been added to main toolbar.

* Support for clickable gopher:// links has been added.

* In the Compose window a warning dialogue is raised if attachments
  that have been added no longer exist on the filesystem at the time
  of sending.

* Buttons to clear header lines in the Compose window have been
  added.

* GnuTLS compatibility mode is now used, this avoids problems with 
  servers that don't comply 100% with the spec, but still exist.
