SpamAssassin Plugin
-------------------

This plugin will filter incoming messages using SpamAssassin. Like the
spamc command from the SpamAssassin package, the message is sent to a
spamd server that decides if the message is spam or not. Filtering of
spam at incorporation time can be turned off.

The plugin also provides the ability to teach spamd to recognize spam and ham,
using the external command sa-learn in local modes or spamc in TCP mode
(this one requires SpamAssassin >=3.1.x). A toolbar button for marking
messages as spam or ham can be added to the main window or the message
window (see "Configuration/Preferences/Customize toolbars).

The plugin is built automatically if you have the required libraries
available.

Message that are classified as spam can be deleted or moved to a folder
that can be specified in the configuration, if the folder is not
specified or not found the default trash folder will be used.

Plugin preferences can be found under "/Configuration/Preferences/Plugins
/SpamAssassin". 

The SpamAssassin plugin uses it's own block in the clawsrc file in your
~/.claws-mail/ directory, and define the following options:
