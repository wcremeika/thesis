// Name:        wx/cocoa/objc/objc_uniquifying.h
// Purpose:     Allows wxWidgets code to get a direct pointer to a compiled
//              Objective-C class and provides a method to fix up the
//              name to include a unique identifier (currently the address
//              of the objc_class structure).

/* A note about this header:
Nothing in here is guaranteed to exist in future versions of wxCocoa. There
are other ways of adding Objective-C classes at runtime and a future wxCocoa
might use these instead of this ugly hack.  You may use this header file in
your own wxCocoa code if you need your own Objective-C classes to be
unqiuified.

You cannot turn this on for 64-bit mode. It will not compile due to opaque
Objective-C data structures and it is not needed because it is a workaround
for a bug that does not exist in the 64-bit runtime.

You should not use this when wxCocoa is built as a dynamic library.  This has
only been tested for the case when wxCocoa is built as a static library and
statically linked to user code to form a loadable bundle (e.g. a Cocoa plugin).
It forces each plugin (when multiple wxCocoa-using plugins are used) to use
its own internal Objective-C classes which is desirable when wxCocoa is
statically linked to the rest of the code.

Do not use uniquifying on your principal class.  That one should be named
differently for different bundles.
