    Helpers for defining macros that expand into a single statement.

    The standatd solution is to use "do { ... } while (0)" statement but MSVC
    generates a C4127 "condition expression is constant" warning for it so we
    use something which is just complicated enough to not be recognized as a
    constant but still simple enough to be optimized away.

    Another solution would be to use __pragma() to temporarily disable C4127.

    Notice that wxASSERT_ARG_TYPE in wx/strvargarg.h relies on these macros
    creating some kind of a loop because it uses "break".
