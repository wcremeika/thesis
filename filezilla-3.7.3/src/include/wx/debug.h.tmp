    wxWidgets can be built with several different levels of debug support
    specified by the value of wxDEBUG_LEVEL constant:

    0:  No assertion macros at all, this should only be used when optimizing
        for resource-constrained systems (typically embedded ones).
    1:  Default level, most of the assertions are enabled.
    2:  Maximal (at least for now): asserts which are "expensive"
        (performance-wise) or only make sense for finding errors in wxWidgets
        itself, as opposed to bugs in applications using it, are also enabled.

// Windows), use the default

    need to provide your assertion handler function.

    pass NULL pointer to it. Doing this will result in not even evaluating
    assert conditions at all, avoiding almost all run-time cost of asserts.

    Notice that this function is not MT-safe, so you should call it before
    starting any other threads.

    The return value of this function is the previous assertion handler. It can
    be called after any pre-processing by your handler and can also be restored

// Compile time asserts
//
// Unlike the normal assert and related macros above which are checked during
// the program run-time the macros below will result in a compilation error if
// the condition they check is false. This is usually used to check the
// expressions containing sizeof()s which cannot be tested with the
// preprocessor. If you can use the #if's, do use them as you can give a more
// detailed error message then.

/*
  How this works (you don't have to understand it to be able to use the
  macros): we rely on the fact that it is invalid to define a named bit field
  in a struct of width 0. All the rest are just the hacks to minimize the
  possibility of the compiler warnings when compiling this macro: in
  particular, this is why we define a struct and not an object (which would
  result in a warning about unused variable) and a named struct (otherwise we'd
  get a warning about an unnamed struct not used to define an object!).

/*
  The second argument of this macro must be a valid C++ identifier and not a
  string. I.e. you should use it like this:

    wxCOMPILE_TIME_ASSERT( sizeof(int) >= 2, YourIntsAreTooSmall );

 It may be used both within a function and in the global scope.
