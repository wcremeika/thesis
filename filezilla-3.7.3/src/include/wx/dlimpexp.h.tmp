   We support building wxWidgets as a set of several libraries but we don't
   support arbitrary combinations of libs/DLLs: either we build all of them as
   DLLs (in which case WXMAKINGDLL is defined) or none (it isn't).

   However we have a problem because we need separate WXDLLIMPEXP versions for
   different libraries as, for example, wxString class should be dllexported
   when compiled in wxBase and dllimported otherwise, so we do define separate
   WXMAKING/USINGDLL_XYZ constants for each component XYZ.
