   If this is defined, wxEvtHandler::Bind<>() is available (not all compilers

   where only g++ and MSVC >= 7 currently support it.

   Recent Sun CC versions support this but perhaps older ones can compile this
   code too, adjust the version check if this is the case (unfortunately we
   can't easily test for the things used in wx/event.h in configure so we have
   to maintain these checks manually). The same applies to xlC 7: perhaps
   earlier versions can compile this code too but they were not tested.
