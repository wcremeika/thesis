    Helpers for defining macros that expand into a single statement.

    The standatd solution is to use "do { ... } while (0)" statement but MSVC
    generates a C4127 "condition expression is constant" warning for it so we
    use something which is just complicated enough to not be recognized as a
    constant but still simple enough to be optimized away.

    Another solution would be to use __pragma() to temporarily disable C4127.

    Notice that wxASSERT_ARG_TYPE in wx/strvargarg.h relies on these macros
    creating some kind of a loop because it uses "break".

/*
    __WXOSX_OR_COCOA__ is a common define to wxOSX (Carbon or Cocoa) and wxCocoa ports under OS X.

    DO NOT use this define in base library code.  Although wxMac has its own
    private base library (and thus __WXOSX_OR_COCOA__,__WXMAC__ and related defines are
    valid there), wxCocoa shares its library with other ports like wxGTK and wxX11.

    To keep wx authors from screwing this up, only enable __WXOSX_OR_COCOA__ for wxCocoa when
    not compiling the base library.  We determine this by first checking if
    wxUSE_BASE is not defined.  If it is not defined, then we're not buildling
    the base library, and possibly not building wx at all (but actually building
    user code that's using wx). If it is defined then we must check to make sure
    it is not true.  If it is true, we're building base.

    If you want it in the common darwin base library then use __DARWIN__.  You
    can use any Darwin-available libraries like CoreFoundation but please avoid
    using OS X libraries like Carbon or CoreServices.

              PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU GET AN ERROR IN THIS FILE!
              **************************************************

    If you get an error saying "wxUSE_FOO must be defined", it means that you
    are not using the correct up-to-date version of setup.h. This happens most
    often when using svn or daily snapshots and a new symbol was added to
    setup0.h and you haven't updated your local setup.h to reflect it. If
    this is the case, you need to propagate the changes from setup0.h to your
    setup.h and, if using makefiles under MSW, also remove setup.h under the
    build directory (lib/$(COMPILER)_{lib,dll}/msw[u][d][dll]/wx) so that
    the new setup.h is copied there.

    If you get an error of the form "wxFoo requires wxBar", then the settings
    in your setup.h are inconsistent. You have the choice between correcting
    them manually or commenting out #define wxABORT_ON_CONFIG_ERROR below to
    try to correct the problems automatically (not really recommended but
    might work).

    assert conditions at all, avoiding almost all run-time cost of asserts.

  things are getting more interesting with ints, longs and pointers

  there are several different standard data models described by this table:

  +-----------+----------------------------+
  |type\model | LP64 ILP64 LLP64 ILP32 LP32|
  +-----------+----------------------------+
  |char       |  8     8     8     8     8 |

  |void *     | 64    64    64    32    32 |
  +-----------+----------------------------+

  Win16 used LP32 (but we don't support it any longer), Win32 obviously used
  ILP32 and Win64 uses LLP64 (a.k.a. P64)

  Under Unix LP64 is the most widely used (the only I've ever seen, in fact)

   First check for specific compilers which have known 64 bit integer types,
   this avoids clashes with SIZEOF_LONG[_LONG] being defined incorrectly for
   e.g. MSVC builds (Python.h defines it as 8 even for MSVC).

   Also notice that we check for "long long" before checking for 64 bit long as
   we still want to use "long long" and not "long" for wxLongLong_t on 64 bit

    Low word style bits is class-specific meaning that the same bit can have
    different meanings for different controls (e.g. 0x10 is wxCB_READONLY
    meaning that the control can't be modified for wxComboBox but wxLB_SORT
    meaning that the control should be kept sorted for wxListBox, while
    wxLB_SORT has a different value -- and this is just fine).

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WX_DEFINE_VARARG_FUNC* macros
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This macro is used to implement type-safe wrappers for variadic functions
// that accept strings as arguments. This makes it possible to pass char*,
// wchar_t* or even wxString (as opposed to having to use wxString::c_str())
// to e.g. wxPrintf().
//
// This is done by defining a set of N template function taking 1..N arguments
// (currently, N is set to 30 in this header). These functions are just thin
// wrappers around another variadic function ('impl' or 'implUtf8' arguments,
// see below) and the only thing the wrapper does is that it normalizes the
// arguments passed in so that they are of the type expected by variadic
// functions taking string arguments, i.e., char* or wchar_t*, depending on the
// build:
//   * char* in the current locale's charset in ANSI build
//   * char* with UTF-8 encoding if wxUSE_UNICODE_UTF8 and the app is running
//     under an UTF-8 locale
//   * wchar_t* if wxUSE_UNICODE_WCHAR or if wxUSE_UNICODE_UTF8 and the current
//     locale is not UTF-8
//
// Note that wxFormatString *must* be used for the format parameter of these
// functions, otherwise the implementation won't work correctly. Furthermore,
// it must be passed by value, not reference, because it's modified by the
// vararg templates internally.
//
// Parameters:
// [ there are examples in square brackets showing values of the parameters
//   for the wxFprintf() wrapper for fprintf() function with the following
//   prototype:
//   int wxFprintf(FILE *stream, const wxString& format, ...); ]
//
//        rettype   Functions' return type  [int]
//        name      Name of the function  [fprintf]
//        numfixed  The number of leading "fixed" (i.e., not variadic)
//                  arguments of the function (e.g. "stream" and "format"
//                  arguments of fprintf()); their type is _not_ converted
//                  using wxArgNormalizer<T>, unlike the rest of
//                  the function's arguments  [2]
//        fixed     List of types of the leading "fixed" arguments, in
//                  parenthesis  [(FILE*,const wxString&)]
//        impl      Name of the variadic function that implements 'name' for
//                  the native strings representation (wchar_t* if
//                  wxUSE_UNICODE_WCHAR or wxUSE_UNICODE_UTF8 when running under
//                  non-UTF8 locale, char* in ANSI build)  [wxCrt_Fprintf]
//        implUtf8  Like 'impl', but for the UTF-8 char* version to be used
//                  if wxUSE_UNICODE_UTF8 and running under UTF-8 locale
//                  (ignored otherwise)  [fprintf]

    This header implements std::string-like string class, wxStringImpl, that is
    used by wxString to store the data. Alternatively, if wxUSE_STD_STRING=1,

// by default we cache the mapping of the positions in UTF-8 string to the byte
// offset as this results in noticeable performance improvements for loops over
// strings using indices; comment out this line to disable this
//
// notice that this optimization is well worth using even in debug builds as it
// changes asymptotic complexity of algorithms using indices to iterate over
// wxString back to expected linear from quadratic
//
// also notice that wxTLS_TYPE() (__declspec(thread) in this case) is unsafe to
// use in DLL build under pre-Vista Windows so we disable this code for now, if
// anybody really needs to use UTF-8 build under Windows with this optimization
// it would have to be re-tested and probably corrected
// CS: under OSX release builds the string destructor/cache cleanup sometimes
// crashes, disable until we find the true reason or a better workaround

    /*
        Overview of wxString conversions, implicit and explicit:

        - wxString has a std::[w]string-like c_str() method, however it does
          not return a C-style string directly but instead returns wxCStrData
          helper object which is convertible to either "char *" narrow string
          or "wchar_t *" wide string. Usually the correct conversion will be
          applied by the compiler automatically but if this doesn't happen you
          need to explicitly choose one using wxCStrData::AsChar() or AsWChar()
          methods or another wxString conversion function.

        - One of the places where the conversion does *NOT* happen correctly is
          when c_str() is passed to a vararg function such as printf() so you
          must *NOT* use c_str() with them. Either use wxPrintf() (all wx
          functions do handle c_str() correctly, even if they appear to be
          vararg (but they're not, really)) or add an explicit AsChar() or, if
          compatibility with previous wxWidgets versions is important, add a
          cast to "const char *".

        - In non-STL mode only, wxString is also implicitly convertible to
          wxCStrData. The same warning as above applies.

        - c_str() is polymorphic as it can be converted to either narrow or
          wide string. If you explicitly need one or the other, choose to use
          mb_str() (for narrow) or wc_str() (for wide) instead. Notice that
          these functions can return either the pointer to string directly (if
          this is what the string uses internally) or a temporary buffer
          containing the string and convertible to it. Again, conversion will
          usually be done automatically by the compiler but beware of the
          vararg functions: you need an explicit cast when using them.

        - There are also non-const versions of mb_str() and wc_str() called
          char_str() and wchar_str(). They are only meant to be used with
          non-const-correct functions and they always return buffers.

        - Finally wx_str() returns whatever string representation is used by
          wxString internally. It may be either a narrow or wide string
          depending on wxWidgets build mode but it will always be a raw pointer
          (and not a buffer).

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// wxMessageOutput is a class abstracting formatted output target, i.e.
// something you can printf() to
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// NB: VC6 has a bug that causes linker errors if you have template methods
//     in a class using __declspec(dllimport). The solution is to split such
//     class into two classes, one that contains the template methods and does
//     *not* use WXDLLIMPEXP_BASE and another class that contains the rest
//     (with DLL linkage).

// We want to support properties, event sources and events sinks through
// explicit declarations, using templates and specialization to make the
// effort as painless as possible.
//
// This means we have the following domains :
//
// - Type Information for categorizing built in types as well as custom types
//   this includes information about enums, their values and names
// - Type safe value storage : a kind of wxVariant, called right now wxAny
//   which will be merged with wxVariant
// - Property Information and Property Accessors providing access to a class'
//   values and exposed event delegates
// - Information about event handlers
// - extended Class Information for accessing all these

// A few notes on implementation of these wrappers:
//
// We need both char* and wchar_t* versions of functions like wxStrlen() for
// compatibility with both ANSI and Unicode builds.
//
// This makes passing wxString or c_str()/mb_str()/wc_str() result to them
// ambiguous, so we need to provide overrides for that as well (in cases where
// it makes sense).
//
// We can do this without problems for some functions (wxStrlen()), but in some
// cases, we can't stay compatible with both ANSI and Unicode builds, e.g. for
// wxStrcpy(const wxString&), which can only return either char* or wchar_t*.
// In these cases, we preserve ANSI build compatibility by returning char*.

// This macro defines string function for all possible variants of arguments,
// except for those taking wxString or wxCStrData as second argument.
// Parameters:
//   rettype   - return type
//   name      - name of the (overloaded) function to define
//   crtA      - function to call for char* versions (takes two arguments)
//   crtW      - ditto for wchar_t* function
//   forString - function to call when the *first* argument is wxString;
//               the second argument can be any string type, so this is
//               typically a template

// In wxUSE_STD_CONTAINERS build we prefer to use the standard hash map class
// but it can be either in non-standard hash_map header (old g++ and some other
// STL implementations) or in C++0x standard unordered_map which can in turn be
// available either in std::tr1 or std namespace itself
//
// To summarize: if std::unordered_map is available use it, otherwise use tr1
// and finally fall back to non-standard hash_map

/*
  This header defines the dynamic arrays and object arrays (i.e. arrays which
  own their elements). Dynamic means that the arrays grow automatically as
  needed.

  These macros are ugly (especially if you look in the sources ;-), but they
  allow us to define "template" classes without actually using templates and so
  this works with all compilers (and may be also much faster to compile even
  with a compiler which does support templates). The arrays defined with these
  macros are type-safe.

  Range checking is performed in debug build for both arrays and objarrays but
  not in release build - so using an invalid index will just lead to a crash
  then.

  Note about memory usage: arrays never shrink automatically (although you may
  use Shrink() function explicitly), they only grow, so loading 10 millions in
  an array only to delete them 2 lines below might be a bad idea if the array
  object is not going to be destroyed soon. However, as it does free memory
  when destroyed, it is ok if the array is a local variable.

//
// JACS: Salford C++ doesn't like 'var->operator=' syntax, as in:
//          { ((wxBaseArray *)this)->operator=((const wxBaseArray&)src);
//       so using a temporary variable instead.

// ============================================================================
// The public macros for declaration and definition of the dynamic arrays
// ============================================================================

// Please note that for each macro WX_FOO_ARRAY we also have
// WX_FOO_EXPORTED_ARRAY and WX_FOO_USER_EXPORTED_ARRAY which are exactly the
// same except that they use an additional __declspec(dllexport) or equivalent
// under Windows if needed.
//
// The first (just EXPORTED) macros do it if wxWidgets was compiled as a DLL
// and so must be used used inside the library. The second kind (USER_EXPORTED)
// allow the user code to do it when it wants. This is needed if you have a dll
// that wants to export a wxArray daubed with your own import/export goo.
//
// Finally, you can define the macro below as something special to modify the
// arrays defined by a simple WX_FOO_ARRAY as well. By default is empty.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WX_DEFINE_SORTED_TYPEARRAY: this is the same as the previous macro, but it
// defines a sorted array.
//
// Differences:
//  1) it must be given a COMPARE function in ctor which takes 2 items of type
//     T* and should return -1, 0 or +1 if the first one is less/greater
//     than/equal to the second one.
//  2) the Add() method inserts the item in such was that the array is always
//     sorted (it uses the COMPARE function)
//  3) it has no Sort() method because it's always sorted
//  4) Index() method is much faster (the sorted arrays use binary search
//     instead of linear one), but Add() is slower.
//  5) there is no Insert() method because you can't insert an item into the
//     given position in a sorted array but there is IndexForInsert()/AddAt()
//     pair which may be used to optimize a common operation of "insert only if
//     not found"
//
// Note that you have to specify the comparison function when creating the
// objects of this array type. If, as in 99% of cases, the comparison function
// is the same for all objects of a class, WX_DEFINE_SORTED_TYPEARRAY_CMP below
// is more convenient.
//
// Summary: use this class when the speed of Index() function is important, use
// the normal arrays otherwise.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// we need a macro which expands to nothing to pass correct number of
// parameters to a nested macro invocation even when we don't have anything to
// pass it
                     

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        



                                                                                                                                                       


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     





// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WX_DEFINE_SORTED_TYPEARRAY_CMP: exactly the same as above but the comparison
// function is provided by this macro and the objects of this class have a
// default constructor which just uses it.
//
// The arguments are: the element type, the comparison function and the array
// name
//
// NB: this is, of course, how WX_DEFINE_SORTED_TYPEARRAY() should have worked
//     from the very beginning - unfortunately I didn't think about this earlier

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WX_DECLARE_OBJARRAY(T, name): this macro generates a new array class
// named "name" which owns the objects of type T it contains, i.e. it will
// delete them when it is destroyed.
//
// An element is of type T*, but arguments of type T& are taken (see below!)
// and T& is returned.
//
// Don't use this for simple types such as "int" or "long"!
//
// Note on Add/Insert functions:
//  1) function(T*) gives the object to the array, i.e. it will delete the
//     object when it's removed or in the array's dtor
//  2) function(T&) will create a copy of the object and work with it
//
// Also:
//  1) Remove() will delete the object after removing it from the array
//  2) Detach() just removes the object from the array (returning pointer to it)
//
// NB1: Base type T should have an accessible copy ctor if Add(T&) is used
// NB2: Never ever cast a array to it's base type: as dtor is not virtual
//      and so you risk having at least the memory leaks and probably worse
//
// Some functions of this class are not inline, so it takes some space to
// define new class from this template even if you don't use it - which is not
// the case for the simple (non-object) array classes
//
// To use an objarray class you must
//      #include "dynarray.h"
//      WX_DECLARE_OBJARRAY(element_type, list_class_name)
//      #include "arrimpl.cpp"
//      WX_DEFINE_OBJARRAY(list_class_name) // name must be the same as above!
//
// This is necessary because at the moment of DEFINE_OBJARRAY class parsing the
// element_type must be fully defined (i.e. forward declaration is not
// enough), while WX_DECLARE_OBJARRAY may be done anywhere. The separation of
// two allows to break cicrcular dependencies with classes which have member
// variables of objarray type.

// This file defines wxTypeId macro that should be used internally in

// not implement C++ RTTI. Also, type defining macros in this file are
// intended for internal use only at this time and may change in future
// versions.
//
// The reason why we need this simple RTTI system in addition to the older
// wxObject-based one is that the latter does not work in template

// We operate with pointer to members of wxEvtHandler (such functions are used
// as event handlers in the event tables or as arguments to Connect()) but by
// default MSVC uses a restricted (but more efficient) representation of
// pointers to members which can't deal with multiple base classes. To avoid
// mysterious (as the compiler is not good enough to detect this and give a
// sensible error message) errors in the user code as soon as it defines
// classes inheriting from both wxEvtHandler (possibly indirectly, e.g. via
// wxWindow) and something else (including our own wxTrackable but not limited
// to it), we use the special MSVC keyword telling the compiler to use a more
// general pointer to member representation for the classes inheriting from
// wxEvtHandler.

// This is an ugly hack to allow the use of Bind() instead of Connect() inside
// the library code if the library was built with support for it, here is how
// it is used:
//
// class SomeEventHandlingClass : wxBIND_OR_CONNECT_HACK_BASE_CLASS
//                                public SomeBaseClass
// {
// public:
//     SomeEventHandlingClass(wxWindow *win)
//     {
//         // connect to the event for the given window
//         wxBIND_OR_CONNECT_HACK(win, wxEVT_SOMETHING, wxSomeEventHandler,
//                                SomeEventHandlingClass::OnSomeEvent, this);
//     }
//
// private:
//     void OnSomeEvent(wxSomeEvent&) { ... }
// };
//
// This is *not* meant to be used by library users, it is only defined here
// (and not in a private header) because the base class must be visible from
// other public headers, please do NOT use this in your code, it will be
// removed from future wx versions without warning.
