    Helpers for defining macros that expand into a single statement.

    The standatd solution is to use "do { ... } while (0)" statement but MSVC
    generates a C4127 "condition expression is constant" warning for it so we
    use something which is just complicated enough to not be recognized as a
    constant but still simple enough to be optimized away.

    Another solution would be to use __pragma() to temporarily disable C4127.

    Notice that wxASSERT_ARG_TYPE in wx/strvargarg.h relies on these macros
    creating some kind of a loop because it uses "break".

/*
    __WXOSX_OR_COCOA__ is a common define to wxOSX (Carbon or Cocoa) and wxCocoa ports under OS X.

    DO NOT use this define in base library code.  Although wxMac has its own
    private base library (and thus __WXOSX_OR_COCOA__,__WXMAC__ and related defines are
    valid there), wxCocoa shares its library with other ports like wxGTK and wxX11.

    To keep wx authors from screwing this up, only enable __WXOSX_OR_COCOA__ for wxCocoa when
    not compiling the base library.  We determine this by first checking if
    wxUSE_BASE is not defined.  If it is not defined, then we're not buildling
    the base library, and possibly not building wx at all (but actually building
    user code that's using wx). If it is defined then we must check to make sure
    it is not true.  If it is true, we're building base.

    If you want it in the common darwin base library then use __DARWIN__.  You
    can use any Darwin-available libraries like CoreFoundation but please avoid
    using OS X libraries like Carbon or CoreServices.

              PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU GET AN ERROR IN THIS FILE!
              **************************************************

    If you get an error saying "wxUSE_FOO must be defined", it means that you
    are not using the correct up-to-date version of setup.h. This happens most
    often when using svn or daily snapshots and a new symbol was added to
    setup0.h and you haven't updated your local setup.h to reflect it. If
    this is the case, you need to propagate the changes from setup0.h to your
    setup.h and, if using makefiles under MSW, also remove setup.h under the
    build directory (lib/$(COMPILER)_{lib,dll}/msw[u][d][dll]/wx) so that
    the new setup.h is copied there.

    If you get an error of the form "wxFoo requires wxBar", then the settings
    in your setup.h are inconsistent. You have the choice between correcting
    them manually or commenting out #define wxABORT_ON_CONFIG_ERROR below to
    try to correct the problems automatically (not really recommended but
    might work).

    assert conditions at all, avoiding almost all run-time cost of asserts.

  things are getting more interesting with ints, longs and pointers

  there are several different standard data models described by this table:

  +-----------+----------------------------+
  |type\model | LP64 ILP64 LLP64 ILP32 LP32|
  +-----------+----------------------------+
  |char       |  8     8     8     8     8 |

  |void *     | 64    64    64    32    32 |
  +-----------+----------------------------+

  Win16 used LP32 (but we don't support it any longer), Win32 obviously used
  ILP32 and Win64 uses LLP64 (a.k.a. P64)

  Under Unix LP64 is the most widely used (the only I've ever seen, in fact)

   First check for specific compilers which have known 64 bit integer types,
   this avoids clashes with SIZEOF_LONG[_LONG] being defined incorrectly for
   e.g. MSVC builds (Python.h defines it as 8 even for MSVC).

   Also notice that we check for "long long" before checking for 64 bit long as
   we still want to use "long long" and not "long" for wxLongLong_t on 64 bit
   architectures to be able to pass wxLongLong_t to the standard functions
   prototyped as taking "long long" such as strtoll().

    Low word style bits is class-specific meaning that the same bit can have
    different meanings for different controls (e.g. 0x10 is wxCB_READONLY
    meaning that the control can't be modified for wxComboBox but wxLB_SORT
    meaning that the control should be kept sorted for wxListBox, while
    wxLB_SORT has a different value -- and this is just fine).
