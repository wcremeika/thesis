                to display more than 1400 files, the program
                crashed (due to a limit of the listview control).
                So the default value is 1000. If you want to
                speed up the startup you can decrease this value.
                Whatever, you can continue to encode, or download
                with no fear !<br>

        - !!! New (4.1) !!! You may encounter a software crash on a corrupted file 
		while scanning (it could happen). In this case, to activate the trace mode, 
		just set in the MP3 EXPLORER.INI file located in Windows directory, 
		in the Setup section, a "Debug" entry to 1 as follow :<br>
		<code>
		...<br>
		[Setup]<br>
		<b>Debug=1</b><br>
		...<br>
		</code>
		This will create a debug.txt in the [ mp3 - explorer ] directory in which you
		will see all files processed, and the last one should be the one with the problem.
		Don't forget to remove this line for a normal use of the software.
        </p>
        <p>- !!! Important !!! On
        some platform, the address bar does not appear and
        the wonderful animate icon is on the left side of the
        window. It's a known problem reported by Microsoft due to an outdated 
		version of the comctl32.dll. The version of this DLL should be 4.71 or
		 upper.  To get an updated version go to :<br>
        <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Com32upd.exe">
		http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Com32upd.exe</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        - Due to an access conflict on the file, the current
        playing file is not retrieved by the scanning process. To
        refresh the list or the cache file, it's better to stop
        your player.<br>
        <br>
        - The command Enqueue works only with player that support
        the feature at the shell level. With some player as Sonique for
        example the Play command do the same as Enqueue if you select the
		 'Append to playlist' option.<br>

		<p>Since version 4.2, the distribution provides an uninstaller</p>
        <p>To remove completely [ mp3
        - explorer ] manually from your system, you should delete the
        following files :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>mp3 explorer.exe</li>
            <li>readme.htm</li>
            <li>*.edf</li>
        </ul>
        <p>from the installation directory which is by default :<br>
        c:\Program Files\mp3 explorer<br>
        and the directory itself.</p>
        <p>You should also delete in
        the Windows directory the file :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>mp3 explorer.ini</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you were using cache
        files, you can delete all mp3cache.mex located in your MP3
        file directories.</p>
        <p>Since v2.0.1, no information is saved in the registry base, so only
        deleting files will leave your system totally clean.</p>
