2012-12-21 11:37:24 +0000 Saurav Ghosh 

	* Since we are not updating both views consistently for all notifications, restrict to deleting items from the active view only.

2012-12-21 11:31:06 +0000 Saurav Ghosh 

	* Allow empty groups to be pre-selected while adding new entries

2012-12-21 11:27:39 +0000 Saurav Ghosh

2012-12-12 22:15:39 +0000 Rony Shapiro

2012-12-04 18:35:21 +0000 Rony Shapiro 

	* Finished os/lib.h normalization: All windows dyn lib calls go through the os/lib wrappers, which add some sanity checks. Non-windows support currently not needed, but should be simple to implement via dlopen() et. al., if & when.

2012-12-03 23:06:39 +0000 DrK 

	* Update VS for wxWidget changes

2012-12-03 21:36:06 +0000 Rony Shapiro

	* forgot to add os/lib.* files

2012-12-03 15:48:55 +0000 Andrey Kuznetsov 

	* 1. Attempt to solve some issues with trailing dots in Group names. Group with dot at the end could be created when import from XML before r5018 or manually from Edit/View dialog. List view show this dots, so TreeView also should show them. Also, when trailing dot isn't shown, Add/Edit dialog shows incorrect group name in Group combobox. Note: CPWTreeCtrl::OnEndLabelEdit() silently exit when new group name have dot in the name or already exists, so some renames could fail (for example, if we have groups "a" and "a.." we couldn't rename "a.." to "a" or "a."). 2. Fix temporary config file creation (ofstream can create only files with char* names, to use non-English path we need wofstream) 3. WinXP haven't CryptProtectMemory/CryptUnrotectMemory in crypt32.dll so we need to load them dynamically. Because we should load library by full path, LoadLibarary code unified and moved to os/lib.*.

2012-12-03 07:10:05 +0000 Saurav Ghosh 

	* Specified a default size so the text ctrl doesn't always start up with zero height.  Also laid out the buttons a little better with "Finish" being the default one.

2012-10-28 10:04:25 +0000 Rony Shapiro

	* Continued cleanup as result of switch to CommandInterface.

2009-12-26 20:37:53 +0000 Rony Shapiro 

	* Refactoring Command code: Instead of a Command base class being a friend of PWScore, defined an mixin class CommandInterface that describes the subset of PWScore interfaces that Commands need to know about. A pointer to the PWScore object, of this type, is passed to all Command-derived objects. The main advantages of this are (1) No need to modify the Command base class each time a subclass is defined (2) One less level of indirection, as Command::Do*() functions no longer have to relay everything to core. (UIinterface.h isn't used yet - it's for next stage of refactoring)

	* Lock on idle timer now works correctly when set to 1 minute. Also removed mutex on idle timer counter, even though a race condition is technically possible, since it's really not worth the added overhead (worse case, timer kicks in when it arguably shouldn't have because of a millisec. or so - who cares?).

	* Refactored user-event definition into ResetIdleLockCounter(). Added mutex to protect m_IdleLockCountDown from race condition, but true "problem" turned out to be resolution of idle timer: The timer ticks every minute, so setting the lockout interval to one minute ensures that it'll kick in, regardless of user events. In Real Life, where interval's > 1 minute, this is not an issue. Will increase idle timer's rate in the next version.

	* New object, PwsBackend, is intended to be the non-UI app context, which will allow other front ends besides the MFC one.  Purely skeletal at this point.

	* This is automatically updated when I edit the .rc in Visual Studio.  I may have temporarily broken things in here, and will need to tweak it a bit.  Caveat coder.

	* Added "Create" button to initial passkey entry dialog.  (Note that this is the only file I'm using Visual Studio to edit, and even so, I do edit it by hand from time to time.)

	* Start adding hooks to HtmlHelp, plus some comments to help me figure things out.  Started marking code with WITH_BACKEND for when I split off the backend (non-UI) code.
