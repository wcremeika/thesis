// version.h is automatically generated from version.in by a custom
// pre-build step that uses git's 'describe' function and
// replaces "g1d3604e" with current git commit info.

// Format: Major, Minor, Build, Revision
//   Build  = 0 for all Formally Released versions
//   Build != 0 for all Intermediate versions
// Full information shown in AboutBox; only Major & Minor are displayed in initial dialog
